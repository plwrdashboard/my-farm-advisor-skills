# DEM Terrain

Use this nested skill for field-scale elevation and terrain work in My Farm Advisor. It covers DEM source routing, source provenance, runtime output names, hydrology warnings, and the rule that generated DEM assets stay outside Git.

## Start Here

- Read [README.md](README.md) for the human guide, source hierarchy, outputs, runtime asset policy, and Open-Elevation rules.
- Read [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) for file-level navigation inside this package.
- Open [`src/dem_terrain/terrain_contract.py`](src/dem_terrain/terrain_contract.py) for product names, path templates, and manifest fields.
- Open [`src/dem_terrain/source_resolver.py`](src/dem_terrain/source_resolver.py) for adapter ids, candidate records, ranking policy, and fallback warnings.
- Read [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md) before adding or changing elevation sources.

## Routing Notes

- Invoke this skill when the request mentions DEM, elevation, slope, aspect, hillshade, curvature, terrain wetness, flow accumulation, depressions, relative elevation, erosion proxies, or DEM source provenance.
- Use it for U.S. 3DEP, Illinois ILHMP/ISGS, NASADEM, Copernicus GLO-30, ALOS AW3D30, optional OpenTopography, and Open-Elevation research-only policy questions.
- Do not call hosted Open-Elevation APIs and do not commit generated DEM rasters, previews, caches, summaries, manifests, or downloaded tiles.
